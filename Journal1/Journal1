  One of the biggest examples of the differences of usability in the same two products are the UI's of Microsoft Windows vs. Linux. One of them was designed for everyone to be able to use, and the other was designed by programmers for programmers. Whenever I want to do something in Linux such as update the graphics driver, I have to open a terminal and Google a bunch of commands to run. Whereas in Windows, it is designed to be able to fix and configure yourself with a whole bunch of hand holding on the way. The main reason for this great difference is that Linux expects its users to be "savvy" to a degree, and have the minimum amount of hand holding necessary. One of the side-effects of this is that most software on earth is written with Windows only in mind, and many things will simply not work on Linux.
