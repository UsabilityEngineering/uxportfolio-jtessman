<h1> Zoom: A Usability Perspective </h1>
  <h1> By Jacob “Kobi” Tessman </h1>

A piece of technology that has exploded in popularity due to the coronavirus is Zoom. Zoom is software that allows you to stream meetings with other people who have Zoom downloaded and running, and have the code to access the meeting. I have used this technology before in my other classes, but I have had to use it several times as much ever since all of my classes have gone online. I have also had to assist my mother in hosting a meeting (which I’ve never done before), as she is a special needs teacher. One of the things that we had to do was to figure out how to arrange a camera similar to a projector setup. Since it was in a pinch, she used the camera on her phone and stuck it between two cans of food to hold it up. It was strange, but it worked. A more recent experience I had with it, is that my audio was not working with the linux version of Zoom, so I had to quickly switch over to Windows 10 in order to get that working and show my parallel programming professor my code. 
	In terms of **learnability**, It is quite cut and dry in regards to what the user has to do to make it work. The host of the meeting (maybe recurring) will post a link to the meeting itself to a website of choice (more often than not blackboard). If the user does not have it installed, then a dialogue box will appear with installation instructions. If the user does, the app will start and the user will automatically join the meeting. It is also really clear in what all of the buttons do with all of the important features, such as sharing your screen/muting yourself.
The usefulness of this app skyrocketed with the COVID-19 pandemic. More people are working from home than ever, and therefore even people whose work is difficult to do from home are using Zoom to engage with their associates. 
	I have run into past problems with the meeting not working from the link that is provided from not just me, but several other people as well. When this error occurs, the user simply has to go and retrieve the code manually either by email or Piazza. When it comes to stuff like school this glitch might not be a big deal, but when it comes to an important meeting between corporations that have millions of dollars down the line this could potentially be disastrous. This means that Zoom is **error tolerant** than we’d like. 
	As good as Zoom is, the technology that I actually prefer for a task like this is Discord. Once you're in the server, you’re in, and you do not need to go and retrieve the access code every single time you would like to host or attend a meeting. You all just need to agree on a time, and go into the designated channel. The one thing that zoom has over discord is better analytics tools and settings. 


**-learnability:** The ability for the user of the technology to figure out how it works from the moment that they first use it. The users will know how to use a product with good learnability minutes after picking it up. 

**-usefulness:** How much the product is able to be used. This one is a bit tricky because it is highly subjective as people will have different needs (a baker isn’t going to use software on designing buildings).

**-error tolerant:** The consequences of the technology not working when it is supposed to. A space station must have next to no error tolerance, while a bookshelf breaking has pretty high error tolerance.
