        One of the things that I interact with almost every day is called the Linux operating system. It's different than Windows or Mac OS in the sense that It's open source (anyone can view or modify the code that went into making it) and It has a few quirks that one needs to get past in order to use it properly. Some of the more casual user's goals include things like:

-Managing fils
-Downloading apps
-Web Browsing

        However, what seperates Linux from the rest is that even though it's free, it was designed by programmers for programmers. There is a certain level of expectation of the user to be "tech savvy" in order to accomplish certain goals. Some of the more advanced goals include:

-Compiling a program
-Running an executable on the command line
-Installing and examining libraries

        In terms of SEE-MULES, Windows and Mac OS have Linux beat in terms of satisfaction, memorable (you use one distribution of Windows or Mac OS and you can more or less use them all), Usefulness (most software on earth was designed for Windows and Mac), and Learnability. I would argue that Linux has greater safety than Windows because Linux was designed from the ground up to be a multi-user OS and therefore has user permissions on files, making it more secure and less virus prone than Windows. Mac OS is high in safety as well because it has a linux backend and It uses security through obscurity (They are very protective of the backend code). I would say that the operating systems are equal in terms of effectiveness and memorability.

        A ton of the tasks that you would want to do in an operating system you need to do in the command line in linux. Things like installing new packages or drivers, system configurations, and administrative duties all require a slew of commands that the user has to know. It can seem a little bit overwhelming at first, but after a few months (especially if you are using Linux to program) the user should know enough commands to navigate around and perform the tasks that they need to. The important commands you need to perform over and over, so I would argue that they have a certain threshold of memorability. In order to start writing this very journal I opened up a command line terminal and typed two commands (this is not the only way to do this task, just an example).
